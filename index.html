            <div>
                <p class="text-ab">What is Climate Change?</p>
                <p class="text-a">Climate Change as defined by National Geographic "is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place."</p>
                <p class="text-ab">Why is Climate Change an imporant issue and what are the impacts?</p>
                <p class="text-a">Climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity, and is now the single most important issue for the world. Global warming presents both risks and opportunities, every rise in warming is worse for the planet than the last. A warmer world can lead to more evaporation, leading to more water in the atmosphere, even by a half degree Celsius. Such changing conditions put our agriculture, health, water supply and more at risk. In just the past few decades: Rising temperatures have worsened extreme weather events. Chunks of ice in the Antarctic have broken apart. Wildfire seasons are months longer. Coral reefs have been bleached of their colors.</p>
                <p class="text-ab">Is Climate Change really real or is it fake?</p>
                <p class="text-a">Evidence such as rising sea levels, shrinking ice sheets, and increase in temperatures are among the many pieces of evidence that Climate Change is real.</p>
                <p class="text-ab">What are the causes and effects of Climate Change?</p>
                <p class="text-a">Scientists say that human activity is the main cause of climate change and this is because we continue to burn fossil fuels, cut down trees, pollute the planet and many other harmful activites without realizing what is at stake. This leds to loss of wildlife, abnormal weather patterns, rising sea levels and many more.</p>
                <p class="text-ab">Where can I get more informaton regarding Climate Change?</p>
                <p class="text-a">You can visit the NASA website <a class="none" href="https://climate.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information, facts, and the impacts of Climate Change or you can go to any other environmental organizations or agenices like the <a class="none" href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-change" target="_blank">United States Environmental Protection Agency </a></p>

                <h3 class="text-a">How can we solve this problem that is in front of us?</h3>
                <p>There is no one answer to this climate crisis, but there are many things that you can do to help make an impact. Some of the most promising ways to mitigate climate change are what we call “natural climate solutions” the conservation, restoration, and improved management of land, in order to increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in landscapes worldwide. Another solution is protecting forests like Pristine woodlands that serve as natural carbon sinks also tropical and northern forests, as well as savannas and coastal ecosystems, store huge amounts of carbon accumulated over centuries. When these areas are disturbed, carbon is released. Preservation of habitats from getting destroyed and also helps regulate water flows, reduces the risk of flooding.</p>

                <p>There are many ways that you can help this fight against Climate Change?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Voice your concerns to elected officials!!!</li>
                    <li>Power your home with renewable energy</li>
                    <li>Eat the food that you buy, and try your best to not have any waste</li>
                    <li>Drive fuel-efficent vechiles</li>
                    <li>Shrink your carbon footprint</li>

                <h3 class="text-a">What can I do if I am a kid?</h3>
                <p>Great Question! As a kid you may not be able to vote or even buy a car that can help the environment, however you can still play a huge role in making
                    this world more eco-friendly and also fight against climate change. NASA Climate Kids gives ways that you can help make an impact: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grow your own awesome vegetables and fruits or even a tree. This can help remove greenhouses gases in the atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>Turn off lights, TVs, computer's when you don't need them. </li>
                    <li>Try your best to use green transporation such as bicycling because a 2 mile car trip puts 2lbs of CO2 in the atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>Try your best to recycle everything you can.</li>
                    <li>Conserve water and close any faucets when you are not using water.</li>
                    <li>You can even think about a green career such as an Ocean Scientist</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Other important ways you can help from Geologist Ed Mathez is by: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start your own environmental club at school to inform people about climate change and reducing energy consumption</li>
                    <li>Ask your parents to replace incandescent with fluorescent lights. (This saves a lot of money!)</li>
                </ul>
